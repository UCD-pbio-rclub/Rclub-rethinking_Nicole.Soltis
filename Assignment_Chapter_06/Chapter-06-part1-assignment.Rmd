#For 05/09/16

## 6E1
Criteria that define information entropy:

- measure of uncertainty is continuous (to avoid stepwise changes in uncertainty in response to changes in probability)

- measure of uncertainty increases with number of possible events (because these make outcomes more difficult to predict)

- measure of uncertainty is additive

## 6E2
Heads 70%:

pH = 0.7, pT = 0.3
```{r}
p <- c(0.3, 0.7)
-sum( p*log(p) )
```

## 6E3
4-sided die: 1 at 20%, 2 at 25%, 3 at 25%, 4 at 30% 

p1 = 0.2, p2 = 0.25, p3 = 0.25, p4 = 0.3
```{r}
p <- c(0.2, 0.25, 0.25, 0.3)
-sum( p*log(p) )
```

## 6E4
4-sided die: never shows 4
```{r}
p <- c(0.33, 0.33, 0.33)
-sum( p*log(p) )
```
