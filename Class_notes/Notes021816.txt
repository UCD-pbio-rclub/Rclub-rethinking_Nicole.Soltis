discussing chapter 2.4

Posterior probability: want to figure out what the curve looks like of Pr (y axis) vs. Pr(water) (x axis from 0 to 1)
Shape of curve matters vs. just peak of curve (Frequentist statistics looks for most probable parameter estimate only)

2.4.1 Grid approximation -- plug and chug! Try a sequence of numbers for your parameter
	MCMC is much like this, but SUBSAMPLES the parameter space

2.4.2 Quadratic approximation -- try to approximate the function

2.4.3 MCMC -- don't know shape of function or parameter space is too extensive
	random sampling with updating within parameter space
	spend more time sampling in the more interesting space
	computationally intensive --> recent increase in useage
